## 🌒 About the Story
In the misty town of **Lirien**, a mysterious lantern glows dimmer each night.  
Legends say its light keeps the shadows of the forest at bay — but something has disturbed its magic.  

You are a traveler drawn to Lirien by fate, curiosity, or perhaps guilt.  
The choices you make will decide whether the Lantern’s light is restored… or extinguished forever.
