# Befriend the guardian
*You step forward cautiously, holding the elder’s charm aloft. The Guardian tilts its head, sniffing the air as if weighing your intent. The forest hushes, leaves trembling in anticipation.*  

> “You… are not like the others,” it murmurs, voice low and rough.  
> “Perhaps… we can walk together.”  

It gestures toward a faintly glowing clearing deeper in the forest. Your heart leaps — maybe the fragment of the secret map lies there. You take a careful step forward.  

*Suddenly, the Guardian lunges. Its teeth flash in the dim light; claws slash through the air. The charm on your wrist glows briefly, but it’s no match for the speed and strength of the beast.*  

> “Foolish mortal,” it hisses.  
> “Trust is a luxury you cannot afford.”  

Before you can react, the Guardian strikes. Darkness explodes around you. The forest falls silent again, leaving no trace of your presence — only the faint echo of your heartbeat fading into the night.
