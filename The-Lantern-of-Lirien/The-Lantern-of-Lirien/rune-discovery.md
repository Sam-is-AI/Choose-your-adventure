# 🔮 Rune Discovery
You kneel before the glowing parchment on Elder Merin’s table. The runes shimmer and twist, almost alive under your fingertips. A low hum vibrates through the air, resonating in your chest.  
As your fingers trace the spiral symbol, a sudden warmth spreads through your palm — the rune is reacting to your touch.

Images flash in your mind: **a forest bathed in silver moonlight**, lantern-like glows drifting between the trees, and a shadowy figure moving silently among the branches. A faint whisper echoes in your ears, carrying a single word: *“Seek.”*

You feel a strange energy tingle across your skin, like the forest itself is reaching out. Your heartbeat quickens as you sense the rune is **not just a clue — it is a key**, and only the careful or brave can unlock its path.

>"Magic listens to those who notice," Elder Merin's voice whispers from memory.
>"The Lantern's heart is hidden, but it calls to those who are worthy. Pay attention to the signs, and act with courage."

The parchment hums again, and a soft light drifts upward, forming an image of a **twisting path through the forest**, pulsing faintly like the Lantern itself. You know the journey ahead will be fraught with challenges — perhaps even tests of your mind, courage, and compassion.
