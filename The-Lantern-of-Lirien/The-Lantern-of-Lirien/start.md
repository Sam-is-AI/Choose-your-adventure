# 🌒 The Lantern of Lirien - Start

You arrive at the edge of **Lirien** as dusk falls, a small town shrouded in silver mist.  
The cobblestone road glows faintly beneath floating lanterns that never seem to burn out.  
They say one lantern — *the Lantern of Lirien* — holds the spirit of the town itself.  
But lately, its light has begun to fade.

As you cross the creaking bridge, an old woman in a hooded cloak watches you closely.  
Her voice is a whisper carried on the fog:

>🌫️"The Lantern is dying... and with it, so will we.
>Find the truth before the final light goes out."

You feel a chill crawl down your spine.
The mist thickens - and three paths open before you.

## ✨ What will you do?

- 🔮 [Visit the Elder's House](meeting-the-elder.md)  
*Maybe the town elder knows more about the dying Lantern.*

- 🍺 [Head to the Tavern](tavern.md)  
 *Locals might talk after a drink or two — if you’re willing to listen.*

 - 🏰 [Walk Toward the Ruined Tower](ruins-path.md)  
 *Old magic lingers there… and perhaps old danger too.*

 *Choose wisely. Every path brings you closer to the truth — or to the dark that waits beyond the Lantern’s light.*
