# ✨ The Lantern Shrine

At the center of the clearing, you find a stone pedestal covered in intricate glowing runes. The pedestal hums like a heartbeat, each pulse resonating with the charm you received from Elder Merin.  

Above it floats a faint shard of light — warm, ethereal, and undeniably part of the Lantern itself. The air is thick with magic, and you feel a gentle tug, as if the Lantern is calling out to you.  

Moss-covered patterns on the ground form a spiral leading both deeper into the forest and toward a hidden tunnel that descends underground. The shard’s glow intensifies when you move closer, urging you to make a choice.  

> “This is a fragment of the Lantern’s heart,” your voice echoes softly.  
> “Take it carefully — it may hold the key to restoring the light of Lirien… or unleash dangers beyond imagining.”
