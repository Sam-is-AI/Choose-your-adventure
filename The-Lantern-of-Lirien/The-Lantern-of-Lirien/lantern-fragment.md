# 🕯️ The Lantern Fragment

The shard hovers in midair, spinning slowly over the pedestal. Its glow is faint at first — gentle, pulsing like the heartbeat of a sleeping creature.  
When you draw closer, your charm begins to hum softly, responding to the shard’s rhythm. The silver threads of light winding from your wrist intertwine with the shard’s glow, forming a brief bridge of energy between you and it.

The air thickens. The forest falls silent — no wind, no birds, just the soft hum of ancient magic.  
You extend your hand. The moment your skin touches the shard, everything around you vanishes in a burst of white light.

You are standing within a vast ocean of radiance — endless, soundless, weightless.  
Above you burns the **Lantern of Lirien**, whole and magnificent. Its flame is golden and pure, a beacon stretching beyond the clouds.  
For an instant, you feel its warmth — peace, clarity, purpose.  
Then, the light fractures. The Lantern explodes into a thousand shards, streaking across the sky like falling stars. The warmth turns to searing cold, and darkness swallows the horizon.

A voice rises from the silence — smooth, ancient, and impossibly calm.

> “So… another bearer reaches for the flame.”
> “You hold only a fragment of me, but even a fragment remembers the world that knelt beneath my light.”
> “Gather my scattered pieces, and I will burn again — brighter than before, brighter than ever.”

The light flickers violently, and the tone darkens.

> “Imagine it, bearer. Power to reshape the night. To bend the shadows. To make the world remember what it lost.”
> “Do you crave it…? Or do you fear it?”

The light fades abruptly, and you are thrust back into the forest clearing.  
The shard now rests in your palm — no longer bright gold, but a soft, pulsing amber, as if waiting for your answer.  
It hums faintly with your heartbeat. The charm on your wrist has gone dark, as if silenced by the shard’s awakening.

You feel a new connection — the weight of its awareness pressing at the edges of your thoughts.
For the first time, you realize the shard isn’t just **alive** — it’s **watching** you.

The pedestal’s runes flicker weakly, revealing two paths ahead:
One leading downward into a tunnel glowing faintly with reflected light.
The other curving toward a circle of ancient stones — a safe and quiet place where you might study the shard without its whispers pressing against your mind.
