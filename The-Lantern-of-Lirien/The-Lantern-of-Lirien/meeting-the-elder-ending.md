# 🩸 Confronting Merin

You return to Elder Merin, the red sigil burning faintly across your wrist.  
Her eyes widen, a flicker of fear crossing her normally unreadable face.  
The air around you vibrates with heat and shadow; the shard thrums violently, resisting any attempt at restraint.

> “You… you’ve touched it,” she whispers, stepping back.  
> “I feared this day. But perhaps… there is still a choice.”

You feel the shard resisting, tugging at your mind and soul. Its whispers grow insistent, promising power, freedom, and revenge.  
Merin places her hands in front of you, murmuring incantations. Silver sparks trace runes in the air, glowing against the darkness around your feet.

**Reject her and embrace the shard:**  
You pull back, eyes glowing faintly from the shard’s power.  
Merin steps away, sorrow etched into her face.  
Flames and shadows swirl around you, bending reality. The shard sings in your mind, unstoppable and eternal.  
You leave, the world subtly bending to your will. You are no longer just yourself; you are something more… and something feared.

**🏁 Ending Achieved: The Corrupted Apprentice**  
*You either walk away partially cleansed but haunted, or fully embrace the shard’s dark gift. Either way, your path is forever changed.*
