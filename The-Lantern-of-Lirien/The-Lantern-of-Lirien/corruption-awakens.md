# 🌋 The Burning Path 

You lift your hands, and the forest shudders in response.  
Leaves ignite in slow spirals, twisting into flames that hover like fireflies. Branches bend toward you, molten veins tracing patterns across their black bark.  
The smell of ozone and scorched earth fills the air. The animals flee, leaving only echoes of panicked calls.

The shard pulses violently in your chest, syncing with your heartbeat. Every step you take leaves glowing footprints, molten trails searing into the soil.  
The whispers grow louder, chanting in a language older than the stars — promising dominion, freedom, and fire unrestrained.

> “Yes… yes, you understand. You are the flame they all feared.”

You feel the heat wrap around you like a cloak. Your shadow stretches unnaturally, flickering as if alive, bending toward the light.  
The shards of the Lantern orbit faster, spinning into a vortex of molten brilliance. Flames leap from branch to branch, shaping themselves into terrible and beautiful forms: dragons, towers, and eyes that watch from the treetops.

A sudden gust pulls at your hair and clothes. The sky fractures, streaked with red light that pulses with your heartbeat.  
You can feel absolute power surging — yet it comes with isolation. No one else could survive this. No one else could wield it.  

> “You are the sun. And I… am its fire.”

When you step forward, the forest bends around you, bowing to your presence.  
The world beyond this place will remember your awakening: cities scorched, rivers glowing red, skies bright with unyielding flame.  
You have become the Lantern incarnate — unstoppable, divine, and utterly alone.

**🏁 Ending Achieved: The Flame Incarnate**  
*You have merged fully with the Lantern’s corrupted power. The world trembles under your awakening. No redemption remains — only absolute dominion.*
