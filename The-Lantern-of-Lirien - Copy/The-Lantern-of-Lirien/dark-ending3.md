# 🔥 The World Aflame

The flame within you has no limit.  
It grows, and the world bends.  
Mountains crack, rivers boil, the air trembles with your breath.  
The Lantern’s fire pours through your veins like liquid stars — too much, too vast, too alive.  

The voice no longer whispers. It *roars*.

> “At last. A bearer unbound.  
> No temples. No rules. No chains.”  

Every step you take leaves glass where soil once lay.  
The forest burns without smoke, its trees weeping embers that rise into a blood-red sky.  
Cities crumble like paper, their towers swallowed by the storm of your light.  

And through it all, you feel everything — every cry, every collapse, every spark you birth and destroy.  
It is beauty. It is horror. It is *you*.

At the center of the burning world, the Lantern reforms.  
Not as the gentle flame of the past, but as an inferno wrapped in a crown of ash.  
Its form mirrors yours now — tall, terrible, magnificent.

> “They feared the night,” it says. “You gave them a dawn that never ends.”  
> “This is balance. This is truth.”  

The flames rise higher, curling like serpents toward the heavens.  
Stars blink out one by one, devoured by the endless glow.  
The horizon itself begins to melt, and the last shadows flee, leaving nowhere left to hide.  

You lift your hands, and the world kneels — not in worship, but surrender.

## 🌒 Epilogue — The Era of Flame

A thousand years pass.  
The oceans have boiled away; mountains are black silhouettes against a golden sky.  
The few who remain whisper of you as the **Eternal Sun**,  
a god who tried to save the world from darkness and succeeded… too completely.

Even now, deep within the molten heart of what remains, a spark still burns —  
the last memory of who you were before the flame consumed your name.

> *Light, without shadow, is nothing but fire.*

And so the Lantern burns on — not as a promise… but as a warning.
