# 🧓 Returning to Elder Merin

You step into Elder Merin’s cottage once more. The scent of herbs and smoke is stronger now, and the soft blue lantern flickers as if in greeting.

> “Ah, I see you have seen the forest’s secrets,” Merin says, smiling faintly.  
> “Take this charm — it will reveal what was hidden and protect you from the unknown.”

She hands you a small pendant glowing with soft light. Its warmth spreads into your hand, and you feel the forest calling.
