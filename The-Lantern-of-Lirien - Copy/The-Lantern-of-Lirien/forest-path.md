# 🌲 The Forest Path

The forest swallows you in its cool, damp embrace as you step onto the narrow path. Mist curls around your ankles, and moonlight drifts through the canopy, painting the mossy ground in silver patterns.

A soft, ethereal glow pulses in the distance — faint, but unmistakably magical. The air carries the scent of wet earth, pine, and something floral, like night-blooming jasmine. Somewhere above, wings flutter silently, and a pair of yellow eyes glint briefly before vanishing into the shadows.

The runes’ vision guides you, and a tingling sensation along your skin reminds you that you are being watched — by the forest itself, or perhaps by something hiding within it. Every step carries risk, but also the promise of discovery.

**A narrow, winding path to the left**, where shadows twist unnaturally and the light seems to bend around unseen shapes. You hear faint whispers — or is it just the wind?
