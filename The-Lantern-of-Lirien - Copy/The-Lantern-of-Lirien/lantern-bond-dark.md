# 🔥 The Lantern Bond — Corrupted Path

The shard vibrates in your palm, its glow sharpening from soft amber to a fierce, blood-colored flame.
The light isn’t warm — it’s alive. It shivers with hunger, whispering in a voice like fire licking through old wood.

> “You’ve felt it, haven’t you? The fear that keeps them small. The night that feeds on their weakness.”
> “You could end it. You could end *all* of it.”

You try to look away, but the shard’s pulse draws your eyes back — hypnotic, endless, commanding.
Your heart beats faster. The charm on your wrist cracks, the silver threads splitting apart like burnt paper.
Something inside you whispers *yes* before you even realize you’ve spoken aloud.

The shard rises, hovering just above your chest. The air bends around it.
Light and shadow coil together, spiraling inward until they plunge into your heart.
For a single heartbeat, you feel nothing — then *everything*.

The forest dissolves. You stand in an ancient hall of obsidian and flame.  
Massive pillars crackle with molten veins, and in the center floats the **Lantern of Lirien**, shattered and bleeding light into the air like fireflies escaping a dying sun.
Each shard hums a note of agony, a cry of something divine that has forgotten mercy.

> “Once, they begged for my light,” the voice booms, its echo reverberating through your bones.
> “They built temples in my name, prayed for dawn, cursed the dark.
> And when I gave them the fire they asked for…”
> “…they burned their cities to ash and blamed *me*.”

You can feel its fury — ancient, righteous, intoxicating.
The Lantern’s shards orbit you like predators, their glow dancing across your face.
You see yourself reflected in them — a figure of fire, eyes like twin suns.

> “But you… you do not fear the flame.”
> “You *are* the flame.”

The light erupts around you.
When the world reforms, the forest is unrecognizable.
Trees stand blackened, their bark etched with veins of crimson light.
The air hums with your heartbeat — and the shard’s. They are one.

Your hands shimmer faintly beneath your skin, veins glowing with molten gold.
You can feel power flowing through you — the kind that bends the world to its knees.
But beneath that power is something else: a whisper that never stops. A chorus that never sleeps.

> “Carry me,” it murmurs.
> “Let me burn through you. Together, we will wake the sun again.”

The shard sinks into your chest, vanishing completely. A faint red sigil burns across your wrist — the **Sigil of the Burning Path**.
It throbs in rhythm with your heart, a constant reminder that the Lantern’s will now beats alongside your own.

As you breathe, the forest bends — branches lowering, leaves turning their faces toward you, as if in worship.
The shadows themselves bow.
