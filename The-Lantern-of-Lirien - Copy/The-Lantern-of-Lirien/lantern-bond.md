# 🌅 The Dawn Restored

The first rays of dawn crest the horizon as you raise the shard toward the heavens.
It thrums softly in your grasp — no longer wild or broken, but whole, alive, singing.
The glow spills from your fingers, climbing skyward like threads of gold weaving through the morning air.

All around you, the forest stirs.
Where ash once smothered the roots, new shoots emerge, trembling with light.
The air hums with warmth. The river nearby mirrors the sky, now silver instead of black.
And for the first time in memory, the songbirds of Lirien return.

The voice of the Lantern comes to you faintly, like the last echo of a dream.

> “You have not restored me,” it whispers.
> “You have *remade* me. Through you, the flame learns mercy.”

The shard lifts from your palm, dissolving into threads of radiant mist that spiral upward.  
They merge with the sun itself — no longer separate, no longer lost.  
The glow fades from your skin, leaving behind a faint mark — the **Sigil of the First Light**, now cool and silver, no longer burning.

Elder Merin appears from the forest’s edge, her robes catching the golden light.
Tears shine in her eyes as she gazes skyward.

> “The Lantern doesn’t rule us anymore,” she says softly.
> “Its light lives *through* us now.”

You nod, your breath steady, the last of the Lantern’s warmth still beating faintly in your chest.
You feel no power, no command — only peace.
And as you look out across the valley, you see it: dawn spreading like a wave, pushing the night to its edges.

## 🌙 Epilogue — The Keeper of Light

Years pass.  
You walk the quiet paths between ruined temples, rivers reborn, and cities learning to breathe again.
Where your feet touch the earth, lamps flicker to life — tiny, gentle flames that guide travelers home.
You never rebuild the Lantern. You never need to.

When you finally fade from the world, it is not with fire, but with sunrise.
Those who tell your story call you the **Keeper of the New Dawn**,
and when storms rage or nights stretch long, people whisper prayers not to gods, but to memory:

> *May the Keeper walk beside me until the morning comes.*

And somewhere, beyond the horizon, a soft light answers.
