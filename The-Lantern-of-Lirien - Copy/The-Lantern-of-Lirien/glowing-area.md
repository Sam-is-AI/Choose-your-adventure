# 🌟 The Glowing Clearing

As you push through the dense forest, a faint glow catches your eye. The mist parts around a small clearing, revealing soft, pulsing lights dancing on the leaves and stones.  

The air is warmer here, and the hum of unseen energy seems to vibrate beneath your feet. You notice faint runes carved into the trees — similar to those Elder Merin showed you — but these ones pulse with a strange, alluring rhythm.  

The glow seems to react to your presence. Every step closer makes the air shimmer and the hum louder, as if calling you toward something important.

> “This light… it is not ordinary,” you whisper to yourself.  
> “Could it be part of the Lantern’s power?”
