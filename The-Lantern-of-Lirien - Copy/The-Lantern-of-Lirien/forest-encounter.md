# 🌲 Forest Encounter — Unprepared

The mist weaves between the twisted trunks of ancient trees, curling like silver smoke. The air smells damp, earthy, and faintly of moss. Shadows stretch and flicker with every step you take, and an eerie quiet has settled over the forest — almost as if the woods themselves are **watching**.

Suddenly, a rustle ahead — a figure emerges from the gloom. The guardian. Its eyes blaze like molten embers, casting light across the gnarled roots and fog. It moves with unnatural grace, each step making the ground tremble slightly beneath your feet.

You remember nothing of Elder Merin’s warnings — no charm, no spells, no knowledge of the forest’s secrets. Panic coils in your stomach as adrenaline takes over.

> “Intruder,” it growls, voice deep and resonant, vibrating through the trees.
> “You dare challenge me without knowledge or protection?”

You raise your weapon, heart pounding, and lunge forward. But the guardian **is faster than your mind or muscles can follow**. A swipe of a clawed arm knocks you off your feet. A brilliant flash of searing light erupts, blinding you momentarily. You stumble and fall onto the mossy ground.

The forest grows silent again, the only sound your ragged breathing. Slowly, your vision fades as the guardian looms over you, victorious.
