# 🌲 Forest Path — The Glowing Clearing

The mist curls around the ancient trees like drifting silver smoke. The forest seems quieter now, almost **expecting you**.  

You remember Elder Merin’s words from earlier:  

> “The one who stole the Lantern’s heart left traces. Follow them, but beware… the forest has its own will.”

Ahead, a faint **glowing area** pulses softly on the forest floor. The light flickers between soft gold and pale green, illuminating the roots and rocks around it. Now that you’ve returned from the elder, you feel ready to investigate it.

The path splits again — deeper into the trees or toward a low stone archway leading underground.
